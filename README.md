# portfolio project

## Goals for this challenge:

To create a sample portfolio of my work using CSS, specifically flex properties, to demonstrate proficiency.

## Requirements

1. the developer's name, 
2. a recent photo or avatar, 
3. links to sections about the developer, 
4. examples of work, and 
5. how to contact them

## Functionality

Links in the navigation should scroll to the corresponding sections

The link to the section about their work should scroll to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

The first application's image should be larger in size than the others

The application's image link should lead to that deployed application

The site should use a responsive layout that adapts to other viewports
