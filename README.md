# portfolio

## Goals for this challenge:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the 

1. ##developer's name##, 2. a recent ##photo or avatar##, 3. and ##links to sections about them##, 4. their ##work##, and 5. how to ##contact them##

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## I'm aiminng for this:
